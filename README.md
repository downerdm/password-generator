# password-generator

The application generates a random password based on user criteria.

The user gets to select the length of the password (from 8 to 128 characters, including 8 and 128).

They also get to choose which character sets to include.  They can choose only one character set up to all four.  The character sets are
uppercase letters
lowercase letters
numbers
special characters

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button the selections are presented.

For length of password, there are a set of validation rules to determine that the user enters something or nothing, that they choose an integer instead of a string, and whether the password is of the appropriate, specified length.
